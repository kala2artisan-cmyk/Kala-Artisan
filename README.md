## 🚀 How to Run

Since this is a static website, you don't need any complex server setup.

1. **Locate the folder**: Go to `c:\Users\Latitude 7400\Desktop\KALA ARTISAN` on your computer.
2. **Open the file**: Double-click on `index.html`.
3. **Browse**: The website will open in your default web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**: styling framework for responsiveness and modern design.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For the mobile navigation menu and simple interactions.

## 🎨 Customization

- **Images**: Currently, the site uses high-quality placeholder images from Unsplash. To use your own images:
  1. Create an `images` folder inside the project.
  2. Save your photos there.
  3. Update the `src="..."` attributes in the HTML files (e.g., change `src="https://unsplash..."` to `src="images/my-jam.jpg"`).

- **Colors**: The brand colors (Dark Green, Soft Gold, Cream) are configured in the script tag inside the `<head>` of each HTML file.
